the governance system sets variables to maximize for the future difficulty per token created to be as high as possible.

We have an oracle that asks "should this variable be pushed up or down?". it pays out shares normally, like oracles do.

How is the block reward set?

We have a lower limit growth rate of 1% annual. The normal governance mechanism can set it to any higher number.
