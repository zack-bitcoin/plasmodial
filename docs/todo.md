oracle_close_tx needs to set the result to 3 if the trading volume is too low.
oracle_close_tx needs to add one more trade in before closing. The creator of the oracle is making a bet against whatever orders are left in the order book.


download blocks should be more asynchronous. replace talker:talk with talk.


Maybe we should stop users from updating the same governance variables twice at once? Alternatively the community could just label the second governance oracle as a bad question.

the oracle needs to be able to update the variables that define the protocol


It is possible to use channel_slash to store data in a channel such that the channel can't be closed with a channel_timeout.
Maybe this is a mistake.


We should download headers in batches, it would be much faster.

javascript light wallets need to be able to do all the channel stuff that full nodes do.

blog post about channels that use untrusted third parties to be secure. So you don't have to stay online all the time.


It is currently possible for an attacker to trick us into ignoring a good block. They trick us into storing a good blocks hash into block_hashes. They give us a good block's header, but mix in some bad transactions, or censor a transaction, or they don't give us some of the merkel tree we need to verify the transactions.
To fix this, each header should contain a hash of all the transactions. We should include the signatures in this hash. This gives us a guarantee that all the data is available at block:check1.

We need a way to close a channel when your partner refuses to sign any SPK. It can either be a new tx type, or we can make solo_close more complex.


constants:difficulty_bits() might be too big.


the new way of doing channel slash has a different problem.
We need the channel to finish at the highest nonce possible. The third party could be bribed to choose a different final state.
We need some way to do the channel_slash transaction again and again, until a higher nonce cannot be found.
Each slasher puts up a deposit, and takes the deposit of the previous.
If the same channel_slash exists for a long enough time period, then anyone can do a channel_timeout transaction, to close the channel.
We need to also add a way for the two parties to work together to close the channel early, so they don't have to wait to do a timeout_tx. We can either make a new tx, or make channel_team_close more complicated.


We should use a CLI program to talk to the node instead of using erlang directly.
It should be able to access everything in /src/networking/internal_handler.erl
We should add everything from easy to internal_handler.erl

We need to update download_blocks so that peers get ranked, and we spend more time talking to higher-ranked peers.

There is a problem where if you crash while syncing with a peer, then you skip trying to sync with any peer lower on the list. this is very bad.

make the api networking/handler be entirely encrypted. This is to protect information about the channels. https://github.com/BumblebeeBat/pink_crypto/blob/master/src/encryption.erl

download_blocks could be more efficient.

maybe nodes need to advertise their own IP/port combo as a peer?

It would be nice if there were some macros for chalang/src/compiler_lisp2.erl that did backtracking. that way we wouldn't have to think about control flow when making smart contracts.


in the white paper we should explain the centralized and trustless exchanges.


Updates for next time we restart at a genesis block:


each tx with a fee needs a to reference a recent hash. Everyone needs to be incentivized to make the hash as recent as possible. This stops transactions from being reused on multiple forks.


Make sure that if something was garbage collected from a merkel tree, and we try accessing the thing, it gives a different message than trying to access something that doesn't exist.
